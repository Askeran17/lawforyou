## User Experience

### Project Goal



### User Stories

### Agile

The project used a Agile methodology that tracked the process of creating the project. An issue was created for each user story.

Visitors can read posts and view video in posts but not to add a comment under this. Registred users can add a comment under posts. Administrator of site can adding, updating & deleting comments. A project Kanban board was used to track progress, with user stories moved between 'ToDo', 'In Progress' and 'Done' columns as appropriate.

Here is link to Agile [User Stories](https://github.com/users/Askeran17/projects/9).

### Database
The project uses the relational database PostgreSQL to store the data. I used PostgreSQL because it is considered one of the recommended databases on the Heroku platform.



## Features

### Existing Features

__Header__



__Main content__



__Footer__

- In the footer I have placed a link to Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube. It looks beautiful with the bootstraps function. The link opens in a separate tab and the visitor is taken to socialmedia he choose, while the site remains open. It is very comfortable. And above links I placed copyright.

__Error 404 page__

- If the user incorrectly specified the page path or clicked on a non-existent page, then he is taken to a 404 page. This page contains a link to return to the main page
